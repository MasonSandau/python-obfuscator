# python-obfuscator
different obfuscator/encryptions methods made by me

Obfuscates text and code that can help protect your code from praying eyes.

Check vmcheck_code.txt for vm check added. You can change how you want the vm to react on vm detection. 

Python minfier is used to make your code smaller in return making the end file size smaller.

(Sorry for shit documentation and horrible commenting. Also sorry for the terrible variable names lol :)

# Example code:
movded to demo folder.
